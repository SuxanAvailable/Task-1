Project Code for MaRs Task#1
# Projects 
1. Trekking Safety Monitor
2. Insect Monitor
3. Distance & Light Sensor
Got the idea for these projects just by looking at the components mentioned in the task. 
# Project 1 (Trekking Safety Monitor)
We all know that forest can be dangerous, but we don't know how much of danger is involved in it. So my project Trekking Safety Monitor helps us analyse the environment for danger and would enable us to take some safety measures. For this I am using a temperature sensor to monitor the temperature of the environment, if it exceeds a limit a warning light (Red) will be shown. To measure the quality of the surrounding air, we are using a Gas Sensor (MQ6) which will monitor the surroundings for air pollutants and will give a warning in the mean of light (Yellow) if it crosses a safety threshold value. An extra feature is soil moisture monitor, if the soil is too dry we will get an indication via light (Blue).
# Project 2 (Insect Monitoring)
I got the idea for this project when a mosquito bit me while I was thinking of any idea for this task. This Insect Monitoring consists of Photoresistor, Temperature sensor, and PIR sensor to detect the insects in the room. Photoresistor turns the circuit on only when it is dark, since insects mostly roam around in the dark. Temeperature sensor is also used to control the circuit, insects, mosquito especially won't survive at a temperature lower that 16 C and higher that 40 C. The circuit will only work when the temperature is between these. PIR sensor detects the motion of insects and if it detects any a LED will be glown indicating the presence of insecst.
# Project 3 (Distance & Light Sensor)
Seeing Ultra Sonic sensor in the list gave me the idea to make distance monitor and from seeing the Ambient Light sensor thought, why not include that too. The circuit contains a Push button, pressing that will trigger the circuit and we can measure the ambient light in the environment using the Ambient Light Senor and the distance between any object in fron of the Ultra Sonic sensor is picked up by the Ultra Sonic sensor itself. These circuit will be open if the push button is not pressed.
